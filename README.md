This is intended to be a set of scripts that helps with:
1) The tranistion from an SVN+Trac development environment to a GitHub development environment
2) Maintaining the GitHub dev environment (dependancy/subtree managment)
3) Help with maintaining GitHub Wiki and adding features ontop of their implementation (scripts not yet added to repo)


These scripts were developed with a specific use case in mind, and then converted after the fact towards a more generalized use case (for you).

Please feel free to use and modify these scripts. If you make changes/improvements, send a pull request and I'll try to include them.

I'm not responsible if these scripts break your stuff, but they shouldn't.
