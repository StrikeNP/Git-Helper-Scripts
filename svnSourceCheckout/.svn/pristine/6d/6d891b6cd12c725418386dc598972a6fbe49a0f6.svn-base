unifdef installation instructions
---------------------------------

Dependencies:
 * unifdef is mostly ANSI C, with a few unixisms
 * unifdefall is a Unix shell script
 * the manual uses the nroff mdoc macros
 * the support and test scripts are Unix shell scripts

To build on Unix, type `make`. You can adjust the compilation options
using the POSIX standard CFLAGS and LDFLAGS make variables.

To install in your home directory, type `make install`
or to install in /usr type `make prefix=/usr install`.
See the start of the Makefile for the install location
variables.

The win32 subdirectory contains build files for MinGW and Visual
Studio 2010 which make use of the FreeBSD code plus some other
portability wrappers.

To build with MinGW, type `mingw32-make -f win32/Makefile.mingw`.

The Windows builds are designed to run from a release tar or zip file
that contains a pre-generated copy of version.h. Building unifdef on
Windows from a git clone is not supported because the repository does
not include version.h and the script that updates it has not been
ported to Windows.

We assume Unix provides the BSD err.h functions and C99 stdbool.h. The
FreeBSD subdirectory has copies of err.c and getopt.c for systems such
as Windows that don't have them built in.
