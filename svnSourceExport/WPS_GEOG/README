The WPS_GEOG directory is used to store the geographical input data for WRF
Preprocessing System (WPS).  This is a large amount of data, so it should not be
committed to SVN.  Rather, it should be placed in a common area on the computer
so that multiple users can have access to it.

The WPS geographical input data can be downloaded from:

http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/download/get_sources_wps_geog.html.

The complete dataset is downloaded in a file called geog_complete.tar.bz2, and
its full address is:

http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/src/wps_files/geog_complete.tar.bz2.

Unpack this file in a common area on the computer.  It will unpack into a
top-level directory called geog.

The minimum dataset (lowest resolution of each mandatory field) is downloaded
in a file called geog_minimum.tar.bz2, and its full address is:

http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/src/wps_files/geog_minimum.tar.bz2.

This file does not unpack into a single top-level directory.  In order for the
dataset to be located properly, it needs to be unpacked in the geog directory.
If the complete dataset is not being used, then a top-level directory named
geog needs to be made.  Otherwise, geog_complete.tar.bz2 needs to be unpacked
first, and then geog_minimum.tar.bz2 needs to be unpacked inside the geog
directory.

The WPS_GEOG directory contains a symbolic link (called geog) to the directory
on the computer that contains the geographical input data.  This link may need
to be edited if the path to the geographical input data changes.
